📝 Test Task: Interactive Text Form
📌 Description
This project is a web application that allows users to enter text, highlight individual letters or groups of characters, and move them around the document.

🎯 Features
Text Input: Users can enter text in a field, and it will be displayed as separate letters.

Character Highlighting:

Clicking while holding Ctrl allows users to highlight individual letters.

Users can highlight multiple characters by drawing a selection rectangle (similar to selecting files).

Letter Drag & Drop:

Letters can be dragged anywhere within the text or across the entire page.

If one letter is dropped onto another, they swap places, preventing overlap.

🚀 Technologies Used
JavaScript (Vanilla JS) – Handles interactive logic.

CSS – Provides styling and highlighting effects.

HTML – Defines the page structure.

No external libraries – Only pure JavaScript and CSS are used.

📂 How to Run
Clone the repository.

Open index.html in a browser.

Enter text, click the button, and interact with the letters!

📌 Possible Improvements
Adding animations for smoother letter movement.

Optimizing the code for better performance.

Implementing state persistence to retain text after page reloads.
